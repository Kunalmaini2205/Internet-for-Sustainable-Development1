            <h2>Welcome to our website!</h2>
            <p> Explore how the internet impacts
            sustainable development and learn about 
            the problems it poses and the solutions it offers. 
            The Internet can play a significant role in promoting sustainable development. 
            Affordable and reliable access to high-speed Internet is crucial, as it opens up 
            new ways of sharing and analyzing information, and provides 
            tools for addressing social and economic challenges. Currently, the digital divide 
            between and within countries is still a significant issue, and efforts should be made to 
            increase access to the Internet, especially in least developed countries. Establishing Internet 
            Exchange Points can help reduce costs and improve quality of service.</p>

            <h2>Internet today's need!</h2>
            <p>However, it's important to acknowledge that the internet itself poses environmental challenges, including energy consumption, 
                e-waste, and carbon emissions associated with data centers and digital devices. Therefore, efforts to harness the power of the 
                internet for sustainable development must also address these environmental impacts through initiatives such as renewable energy 
                usage, energy-efficient technologies, and responsible e-waste management.</p>
